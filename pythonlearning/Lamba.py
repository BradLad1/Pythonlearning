#lamba functions
#Lamba functions are small anonymous functions
#lamba functions can take any number of arguments but can only have one experssion

#THE FIRST word after lamba is arugment

#the experssion is after: The expersion will return a value
#so lambas are like a shorter way to write functions


answer =lambda num: num *2

print(answer(6))

#Lambas can take in multiple arugment

multiply = lambda a, b: a*b
